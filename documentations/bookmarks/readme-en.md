# 📘 QcmMaker — Bookmarks Guide

![Bookmark Introduction](https://www.qcmmaker.com/documentations/bookmarks/resources/bookmark_teasing.jpg)

Bookmarks in **QcmMaker** allow you to save and revisit specific questions from your quizzes.  
They help you organize, review, and replay questions that matter most — whether they were **skipped**, **answered incorrectly**, or **marked for revision**.

## 🔖 What is a Bookmark?

A **bookmark** is a custom collection of quiz questions that you can revisit later.  
Each bookmark acts like a folder where you can group questions based on your learning goals.

### Common examples
- 🧠 **Weakness Points** – questions you failed and need to review later.  
- ❓ **Skipped Questions** – questions you didn’t answer.  
- 🧩 **Next Exam** – questions to prepare for your next test.  
- 🏆 **Personal Selection** – your own chosen set of questions.
